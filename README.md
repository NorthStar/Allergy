Allergy
=======

This is an iOS app created by team 'Food Scan' during LinkedIn HackDay on July 11, 2014, authored by Mimee. 
Rachel Friedman @rlfriedm has an Android version.

Working app with workflow:
At first opening, check or not check some pictures one by one regarding whether one allergen is concerning.
Once the user gets through the entire list, the user sees a list view of all the allergens, with the ones that might matter switched ‘ON’. 
Using the camera tab, one can scan the barcode of a particular food and get told if it is okay to eat.

At this stage the app is rather simple. The first sync is all the progress up till 1pm on 12 July. It was a great night.


Usage
========

Do not run it in the simulator or the app will crash. This is due to using the camera.

Notes
========

The app key for the Label API is exposed, because... hackathon. That free account will expire in 30 days.
